//The Nonvalue Values
//For the undefined type, there is one and only one value: undefined.
//For the null type, there is one and only one value: null.So for both
//of them, the label is both its type and its value.
//null is an empty value.
//undefined is a missing value.
//    Or:
//undefined hasn’t had a value yet.
//null had a value and doesn’t anymore.

//void operator
var a = 42;
console.log(void a, a); // undefined 42
